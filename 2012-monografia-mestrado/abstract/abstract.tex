Scientific experiments produce a large amount of information that require processing for further analysis. A scientist, that not work in computing area, does not always have the skills to develop their own test environment. Therefore the usage of executors of scientific workflows have been widely studied. The main advantage in use a workflow scientific processor is the transparency offered for the scientist regarding the manner in which the experiments will be organized, distributed and processed. This work proposes a model for creating an environment that be able to process these workflows. The emphasis is on a intelligent schedule that uses techniques to solve planning problems in the area of artificial intelligence.
